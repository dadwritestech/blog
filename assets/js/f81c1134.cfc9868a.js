One minute everything is fine, the next you\'re staring at a buffering wheel while your kids complain about lag. The modern home is a digital warzone, with phones, laptops, TVs, and a dozen other smart gadgets all fighting for bandwidth.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nThe inevitable question comes up: will buying a new router with a bigger number on the box solve anything? Or is it just more marketing noise? As an architect of systems, I can tell you the answer is \\"it depends.\\" Let\'s dismantle the problem and build a clear answer.\\n\\n## Wi-Fi Generations in a Nutshell\\n\\nForget the marketing terms for a moment. Each new Wi-Fi generation is really just a new tool designed to solve a traffic problem.\\n\\n### Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac): Old Reliable\\n\\nThis is likely what you have now. For years, Wi-Fi 5 has been a trusty workhorse. It gets the job done for a handful of devices. Its limitation? Congestion. It treats every data request like a separate trip, which gets horribly inefficient when things get busy.\\n\\n### Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax): The Efficiency Expert\\n\\nHere\'s the first thing to understand: Wi-Fi 6 isn\'t really about a massive top speed increase for one device. Its genius is in how it handles a crowd. It uses a technology called OFDMA that radically improves efficiency.\\n\\n**The Analogy:** Think of a delivery truck. Wi-Fi 5 makes a separate trip for every single house. Wi-Fi 6 is the smart driver who loads the truck with packages for the whole neighborhood and delivers them all in one optimized route. It\'s a huge deal. The network just feels snappier for everyone, even when it\'s crowded.\\n\\n### Wi-Fi 6E: The Private Superhighway\\n\\nThis one is simpler than it sounds. It\'s just Wi-Fi 6 with a new trick. It gets exclusive access to a brand new 6 GHz radio band.\\n\\n**The Analogy:** Imagine the city opened a brand new, empty, eight-lane superhighway right next to your clogged city streets. That\'s the 6 GHz band. But there\u2019s a catch\u2014only the newest cars (your Wi-Fi 6E-compatible devices) are even allowed on the entrance ramp. This leaves it completely free of interference from your neighbors and all your older gadgets.\\n\\n### Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be): The Over-the-Top Powerhouse\\n\\nAnd then there\'s the new frontier. Wi-Fi 7 is built for a future of multi-gigabit internet and data-hungry tech we barely use yet. Its headline feature is Multi-Link Operation (MLO).\\n\\n**The Analogy:** This is a futuristic car that can use multiple highways at the same time to get where it\'s going. A Wi-Fi 7 device can talk to a Wi-Fi 7 router over the 5 GHz and 6 GHz bands simultaneously, merging them into one ultra-fast, ultra-stable connection. It\'s impressive, but it\'s overkill for most. For now.\\n\\n## The Real Question: Should You Spend Your Money?\\n\\nLet\'s get down to it. Here\u2019s a pragmatic checklist.\\n\\n### It\'s time to buy Wi-Fi 6 if...\\n\\n*   Your list of connected devices is creeping past twenty.\\n*   The whole family is online and things just grind to a halt.\\n*   You\'re paying for fast gigabit internet, but your wireless speeds are a joke.\\n\\nHonestly, if your current router is more than four years old, this is your new baseline.\\n\\n### You could actually benefit from Wi-Fi 6E if...\\n\\n*   You live in an apartment and can see fifty different Wi-Fi networks from your couch. That congestion is real.\\n*   You\u2019re a serious gamer or streamer, and latency is your sworn enemy.\\n*   You own a brand-new phone or high-end laptop and want to use the advanced features you paid for.\\n\\n### Just hold off on Wi-Fi 7 unless...\\n\\n*   You are the person who has to have the newest gadget, period.\\n*   You have a multi-gig internet plan (2 Gbps or faster) piped into your house.\\n*   Your job involves moving enormous files wirelessly between computers at home.\\n\\n## The Catch\u2014And Don\'t Miss This Part\\n\\nA new router is only half the story. Your phone, your laptop, your game console\u2014they are the other half. You can have a shiny new Wi-Fi 6E router, but if your phone is three years old, it can\'t see or use that new 6 GHz superhighway. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Your network is only as good as the devices using it.\\n\\n## The Architect\'s Verdict\\n\\nSo, what\u2019s my final recommendation?\\n\\nIt\'s simple. For most families in 2025, a solid Wi-Fi 6 router is the smartest investment you can make. It\'s the pragmatic, cost-effective choice that solves the actual problem most people have: a home network crowded with devices.\\n\\nWi-Fi 6E is a powerful, and justifiable, luxury upgrade. If you live with heavy interference or you\'re an enthusiast with the latest tech, it delivers a clean, fast experience you can absolutely feel.\\n\\nAs for Wi-Fi 7? It\'s an incredible piece of engineering that you can safely ignore for now. Let the early adopters pay the premium.\\n\\nStop chasing the biggest number on the box. Buy the upgrade that solves the problem you actually have."},{"id":"windows-context-menu","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/windows-context-menu","source":"@site/blog/Windows-Context-Menu.md","title":"Windows 11\'s Context Menu: A Usability Downgrade?

(And My Workaround)\\n\\nI still remember the first time I right-clicked something in Windows XP. I had no idea what a \u201ccontext menu\u201d was back then\u2014I just knew that right-clicking felt like unlocking a *hidden cheat code* for my PC. Fast forward through Vista, 7, 8 (ugh), and 10, and I\u2019ve gotten pretty comfortable with how Windows handles everyday tasks.  \\n\\nBut then Windows 11 came along. And\u2026 yeah. This new right-click menu? Not a fan.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Why the New Context Menu Feels Like a Downgrade\\n\\nMicrosoft decided, in its infinite wisdom, to *hide* most of the right-click options behind a \u201cShow more options\u201d button. Now, I sort of get the logic.  \\n\\n- Performance \u2013 Maybe a slimmer menu loads faster? (I never had an issue before, but okay.)  \\n- Simplification \u2013 Casual users probably don\u2019t need 90% of those options anyway.  \\n\\nBut for people like me\u2014who right-click constantly throughout the day(mostly nervously refreshing.. :D)\u2014this extra step feels like someone moved my coffee mug an inch to the left every time I reach for it. Small change, big annoyance.\\n\\nAnd here\u2019s the kicker: the full menu is still there. Microsoft just buried it under an extra step, like some kind of twisted usability prank.  \\n\\n## The Shift+Right-Click Shortcut (A Band-Aid Fix)\\n\\nThere *is* a workaround\u2014if you hold *Shift* and Right-Click, it brings up the old-school full menu instantly. I found this out after an embarrassing amount of frustration, clicking \u201cShow more options\u201d like some kind of NPC stuck in a loop.  \\n\\nDoes it work? Yeah.\\n\\nDoes it feel like an unnecessary extra step? Also yeah.  \\n\\nIt\u2019s like adding a secret handshake to open your own fridge. *Why?*\\n\\n## The Real Fix: Bringing Back the Classic Menu (Registry Edit)  \\n\\nAfter realizing I was one click away from losing my mind, I did some digging. Turns out, you can restore the old menu permanently with a quick registry edit.  \\n\\nQuick warning: Messing with the registry is like doing surgery on your OS\u2014screw it up, and things can go sideways fast. Back up your registry before you try this.  \\n\\n### Here\u2019s how to fix it\\n\\n1. Open Command Prompt\\n   - Hit *Win + R* (or use windows search, if you prefer it), type `cmd`, and press Enter.  \\n\\n2. Paste this command and hit Enter:\\n\\n   ```sh\\n   reg add HKCU\\\\Software\\\\Classes\\\\CLSID\\\\{86ca1aa0-34aa-4e8b-a509-50c905bae2a2}\\\\InprocServer32 /ve /d \\"\\" /f\\n   ```  \\n\\n3. Restart Explorer (or Just Reboot Your PC)  \\n   - Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open Task Manager.  \\n   - Find **Windows Explorer**, right-click it, and choose **Restart**.  \\n\\nAnd just like that\u2014Boom! The classic context menu is back.  \\n\\n>If it did\'nt work, it\'s likely you are not logged in with Admin permissions. If that is the case, contact your administrator to do this for you, or stick with using *Shift*+ Right-Click.\\n\\n## Undoing the Change (If You Ever Want To)\\n\\nIf for some reason, you start *missing* the \u201cShow more options\u201d button (hey, you do you), here\u2019s how to undo the tweak:  \\n\\n```sh\\nreg delete HKCU\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Classes\\\\CLSID\\\\{86ca1aa0-34aa-4e8b-a509-50c905bae2a2} /f\\n```  \\n\\nRestart Explorer again (or your PC), and it\u2019ll go back to the Windows 11 default.  \\n\\n## Final Thoughts: Microsoft, Just Give Us the Option (a toggle at least)\\n\\nHonestly, this never needed to be an issue in the first place. The new context menu isn\u2019t *bad*\u2014it just should\u2019ve been optional. Let users choose between the new style and the classic menu. Problem solved.  \\n\\nBut knowing Microsoft? Yeah\u2026 I won\u2019t hold my breath."},{"id":"tech-gadgets-for-the-modern-dad","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/tech-gadgets-for-the-modern-dad","source":"@site/blog/Tech-Gadgets-for-the-Modern-Dad.md","title":"Tech Gadgets for the Modern Dad: Balancing Work, Play, and Family","description":"A short write up discussing tech modern dad\'s can use.","date":"2024-02-20T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Tech Guides","permalink":"/blog/tags/tags/techguides","description":"Guides and tutorials related to technology."}],"readingTime":2.4,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Dad Writes Tech","title":"Technical Writer, Dad, and newb Gamer","imageURL":"https://www.dad-writes-tech.com/images/avatar.jpg","key":"DadWritesTech","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"tech-gadgets-for-the-modern-dad","title":"Tech Gadgets for the Modern Dad: Balancing Work, Play, and Family","date":"2024-02-20T00:00:00.000Z","description":"A short write up discussing tech modern dad\'s can use.","authors":["DadWritesTech"],"tags":["techGuides"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Windows 11\'s Context Menu: A Usability Downgrade?

With the gaming world all abuzz about Nvidia\'s RTX 4070 Ti Super and RTX 4080 Super, you might find yourself caught in a whirlwind of wonder, thinking, \\"Is it time for an upgrade?\\" But before you start raiding your piggy bank, let\'s dive into why embracing the status quo might just be your smartest move. Let\'s take a closer look at my own case, shall we?\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## The Case for Contentment\\n\\nWhen it comes to my gaming lineup \u2013 think Overwatch 2 and Cities Skylines 2 \u2013 these titles are more about the joy of the game than pushing my Nvidia 3060 laptop GPU to its limits. Overwatch 2? It\'s all about that adrenaline-pumping moment of landing the perfect shot on a nimble Genji, less about the shimmering reflections in a digital puddle. And Cities Skylines 2? It\'s the thrill of mastering those maddening traffic jams, not the way the sunlight dances on the water. It\'s these crafted experiences and personal victories that truly define gaming, transcending the need for the latest specs to enjoy what really matters.\\n\\n## The Wallet-Friendly Wisdom\\n\\nLet\'s talk economics for a second. Eyeing that RTX 4080 Super might seem like a good idea until you equate it to the mountain of avocado toasts you\'d be sacrificing. Picture this: a veritable Everest of creamy, green goodness swapped for a few extra frames per second. Would you really notice the difference while you\'re deep in strategy, trying to outmaneuver a crafty Sombra? This absurd comparison highlights the joy and memories that could be bought instead of just a fleeting upgrade in tech.\\n\\n## The Future-Proofing Fallacy\\n\\nFuture-proofing in the tech world is like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands \u2013 a compelling but ultimately futile effort. Today\'s technological marvel is tomorrow\'s average Joe. By resisting the urge to upgrade at every turn, you\'re not falling behind; you\'re strategically biding your time, waiting for that monumental leap in innovation that truly changes the game. It\'s about making a move that counts, not just keeping up with the Joneses.\\n\\n## The Compatibility Conundrum\\n\\nVenturing down the upgrade path can quickly become a journey through a technological quagmire, where every \\"simple\\" change leads to another, and then another. Think of it as opening Pandora\'s box \u2013 what starts as a GPU upgrade spirals into a saga involving power supplies, cooling systems, and perhaps a new motherboard. It\'s a vivid reminder that in the world of tech, every action has a reaction, often more complex and costly than anticipated.\\n\\n## Embracing the Good Enough\\n\\nIn the grand tapestry of gaming, it\'s not the specs that make the experience, but the stories we weave and the challenges we conquer. My current setup, much like a beloved underdog from a cult classic, might not have the latest gadgets and gizmos, but it\'s got heart. It\'s a testament to the power of creativity and resourcefulness, proving that you don\'t need the fastest, shiniest hardware to have a good time. This setup, with all its quirks and limitations, is a celebration of gaming at its most pure \u2013 fun, engaging, and endlessly surprising.\\n\\n## The Verdict: Hold the Line!\\n\\nSo, to my fellow casual gamers, let\'s stand together, gamepads and keyboards held high, in defiance of the relentless push for the new. Let\'s invest in the games that bring us joy, the experiences that bring us together, and yes, even that extra round of avocado toast. The future will undoubtedly usher in GPUs that will make the RTX 4080 Super look quaint, and when that day comes, we\'ll be ready. But for now, let\'s savor our games, warts and all, and revel in the knowledge that the best upgrade is the one we didn\'t need to make. After all, in the world of gaming, it\'s the heart of the player, not the hardware, that truly makes the difference."},{"id":"retail-loyalty-program","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/retail-loyalty-program","source":"@site/blog/Retail-Loyalty-Program.md","title":"What is a Retail Loyalty Program","description":"A short write up explaining Retail Loyalty Programs.","date":"2024-02-03T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"General","permalink":"/blog/tags/tags/general","description":"General topics and discussions."}],"readingTime":3.37,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Dad Writes Tech","title":"Technical Writer, Dad, and newb Gamer","imageURL":"https://www.dad-writes-tech.com/images/avatar.jpg","key":"DadWritesTech","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"retail-loyalty-program","title":"What is a Retail Loyalty Program","date":"2024-02-03T00:00:00.000Z","description":"A short write up explaining Retail Loyalty Programs.","authors":["DadWritesTech"],"tags":["general"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"To Upgrade or Not to Upgrade: The Casual Gamer\'s Dilemma in 2024","permalink":"/blog/the-casual-gamers-dilemma-in-2024"},"nextItem":{"title":"Sending a Message with a Picture on WhatsApp","permalink":"/blog/sending-a-message-with-a-picture-on-whatsapp"}},"content":"Ever wondered why some stores ask you to sign up for their \\"exclusive\\" clubs or offer you a card that promises rewards? Welcome to the world of Retail Loyalty Programs, a popular strategy businesses use to keep customers coming back for more.\\n\\n>**Key Takeaways**\\n>\\n>- Retail Loyalty Programs are strategic initiatives designed to foster customer retention and engagement by offering rewards for repeated business.\\n>- These programs not only benefit customers through savings and personalized experiences but also provide retailers with valuable data and increased brand loyalty.\\n>- Successful implementation requires careful consideration of costs, data security, system integration, and adaptability to changing customer preferences and market trends.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## The Basics\\n\\nA Retail Loyalty Program is a structured marketing strategy designed by retailers to encourage customers to continue shopping at or using the services of businesses associated with each program. At its core, it\'s about creating a sense of belonging and appreciation for customers.\\n\\n## How It Works\\n\\n**Membership**: First, you sign up, often for free, providing basic information like your name, email, and sometimes preferences. In return, you might get a physical card, a digital card, or simply an account number tied to your profile.\\n\\n**Earning Points or Credits**: Every time you make a purchase, you earn points, miles, or credits, depending on the program\'s type and structure. The more you shop, the more you earn. Sometimes, points can vary by product or service, incentivizing purchases in certain categories.\\n\\n**Benefits and Rewards**: These points aren\'t just for show; they\'re your ticket to a variety of rewards. This could range from discounts, special offers, early access to sales, and exclusive deals to free products or services. Some programs even offer tiered memberships, where the benefits increase as you climb up the loyalty ladder.\\n\\n**Personalized Experience**: Many loyalty programs use the data from your shopping habits to tailor offers and communications specifically to your interests. This personalized touch not only makes shopping more enjoyable but also more rewarding.\\n\\n## The Mutual Benefit\\n\\nFor customers, the appeal is clear: save money, gain rewards, and receive a personalized shopping experience. For retailers, loyalty programs offer invaluable customer data, increase retention rates, encourages brand advocacy, and boost overall sales. It\'s a win-win situation where your loyalty to a brand is recognized and rewarded.\\n\\n## Considerations for Businesses\\n\\nImplementing loyalty programs involves careful planning around costs, as rewarding customers can be expensive. Businesses need to ensure rewards are enticing without undermining profits.\\n\\nPrivacy and data security are paramount, as these programs often collect personal customer information. Integration with existing systems, like point-of-sale and CRM software, is crucial for seamless operation.\\n\\nAdditionally, businesses must stay adaptive, updating the program to remain appealing and relevant to customer preferences and market trends, ensuring long-term engagement and value.\\n\\n## Few Examples\\n\\n- Starbucks Rewards: When you order through the Starbucks App, you accumulate reward points. These can be redeemed for free drinks, food, and Starbucks merchandise.\\n- Uber Rewards: Each dollar spent on Uber rides earns you points. These points can be used for benefits like priority pickups and flexible cancellations. Additionally, accumulating more points can unlock higher tiers with even greater rewards.\\n- Amazon Prime: By paying an annual fee, members gain access to a wide range of benefits. These include free 2-day shipping on numerous products, as well as access to Amazon\'s video and music streaming services, among others.\\n\\nSo, the next time you\'re asked to join a loyalty program, you\'ll know exactly what\'s in store for you. Whether it\'s for your favorite coffee shop, clothing store, or online retailer, these programs are all about enhancing your shopping experience and building a lasting relationship with the brand.\\n\\n## References\\n\\nI have used the following articles for my research:\\n\\n- [Loyalty Program: Definition, Purposes, How It Works, Example](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loyalty-program.asp)\\n- [16 customer loyalty programmes of 2024 + how they work](https://www.zendesk.co.uk/blog/loyalty-rewards/?_ga=2.212380436.1861318797.1707002223-703047045.1707002223)\\n- [What Is a Loyalty Program? 5 Best Examples](https://www.shopify.com/blog/loyalty-program)\\n- [Loyalty program for retailers: 10 winning examples](https://www.openloyalty.io/insider/best-retail-loyalty-programs)"},{"id":"sending-a-message-with-a-picture-on-whatsapp","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/sending-a-message-with-a-picture-on-whatsapp","source":"@site/blog/Sending-a-Message-with-a-Picture-on-WhatsApp.md","title":"Sending a Message with a Picture on WhatsApp","description":"A short write up on how to send pictures using WhatsApp.","date":"2024-02-03T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Tech Guide","permalink":"/blog/tags/tags/techguide","description":"Guides and tutorials related to technology."}],"readingTime":3.96,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Dad Writes Tech","title":"Technical Writer, Dad, and newb Gamer","imageURL":"https://www.dad-writes-tech.com/images/avatar.jpg","key":"DadWritesTech","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"sending-a-message-with-a-picture-on-whatsapp","title":"Sending a Message with a Picture on WhatsApp","date":"2024-02-03T00:00:00.000Z","description":"A short write up on how to send pictures using WhatsApp.","authors":["DadWritesTech"],"tags":["techguide"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"What is a Retail Loyalty Program","permalink":"/blog/retail-loyalty-program"},"nextItem":{"title":"GhostintheAttic","permalink":"/blog/ghost-in-the-attic"}},"content":"Enhance your WhatsApp conversations by sharing pictures.

He was very healthy, a bit too healthy, one can say. He was round like a tomato, and that\'s what his classmates used to call him. He wasn\'t very popular and didn\'t have any friends. They had recently moved to a new city where his father got a new job and had bought a new house on the outskirts of the town because it was a bit close to his work and Max\'s new School.\\n\\nMax was very nervous on his first day at School, it was the middle of the year, and he will be the new kid in the class. His first day at School went exceptionally uneventful, and he couldn\'t make any friends. He was an introvert, after all.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nBut in the evening, on the way back home, a girl, one of his classmates, came to him while everyone was about to leave, \\"Do you know where you live?\\" she asked, speaking frantically. \\"I think I do,\\" said Max, looking confused.\\n\\n\\"That\'s not what I meant. Did you know the house you live in is haunted?\\" she asked excitedly. Max thought hard. He knew he had a chance of making some friends if he made up a story about some ghosts. So he went on with her story.\\n\\n\\"I heard people say that and heard some noises in the middle of the night.\\" He said, looking awkwardly at her. She and everyone else in the room were pretty excited.\\n\\nThey immediately offered to come home with him and investigate.\\n\\nThat evening, 5 of his new classmates got to his home by 8 PM as his dad would be working till late at night, and he would be alone in the house. He switched off the lights to add to the scare of what was already in the talk a haunted house. He would be the hero by not being frightened in front of his new friends.\\n\\nThey started investigating the house. As it was dark, everything looked creepy. The old statues that were part of the purchase were left without a hint of cleaning. The second floor, which no one had used, was submerged in an ocean of dust. Spiders had spun their world of webs throughout.\\n\\nAfter an hour of investigation, the kids were all feeling relaxed. They had called out to ghosts and spirits but received no response. Suddenly they heard some strange noise coming from the attic of the second floor. Everyone was terrified. Not a single person dared to take another step. Max was ecstatic; he was going to investigate and be the hero that saved the day. Even though everyone urged him not to, he went towards the attic.\\n\\nIt was a windy evening. Windows started fluttering, and there was a sudden sound from the attic. Everyone was literally petrified. Max went on towards the attic, ignoring the screaming girl. One of his classmates called the police and informed them about the scene they were in. The police responded immediately, as recent cases of intruders were rising.\\n\\nSoon two nearby officers arrived at Max\'s building and made their way into the house. They had their guns out, being positively sure about an intruder. Soon they reached the second floor and asked Max to not open the attic. They went in as the kids watched with visible tension. Police opened the door to the attic in the corner and returned with a wooden stick covered in white cloth attached to a rope stuck to the windows. Whenever the windows fluttered because of the wind, the rope attached to the wooden stick would hit the wall and make a sound. All the kids thought it was a ghost that was causing the noises.\\n\\nOfficers understood it was a prank played by Max. They left after lecturing him about the seriousness of the situation. All his classmates were angry at his ploy to get everyone\'s attention. Max realized his mistake and told everyone what he had gone through and why he did that.\\n\\nLater his classmates accepted his apology, and they all became good friends.\\n\\n_Life is what you make of it; you are who you are, inside or out. If you want other people to respect you, give them the respect they deserve. Be you, and you will be accepted by everyone. Everyone is unique in their own way, don\'t let anyone tell you any different. When we pretend to be someone we are not, it won\'t bring joy to anyone. Not even to yourself._\\n\\n_The saying goes, \\"Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don\'t matter, and those who matter don\'t mind.\\"_"},{"id":"testpost","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/testpost","source":"@site/blog/Testpost.md","title":"Test 1","description":"This is a test post","date":"2024-01-24T10:34:54.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Test","permalink":"/blog/tags/tags/test","description":"Test posts."}],"readingTime":0.01,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Dad Writes Tech","title":"Technical Writer, Dad, and newb Gamer","imageURL":"https://www.dad-writes-tech.com/images/avatar.jpg","key":"DadWritesTech","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"testpost","title":"Test 1","date":"2024-01-24T10:34:54.000Z","description":"This is a test post","authors":["DadWritesTech"],"tags":["test"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"GhostintheAttic","permalink":"/blog/ghost-in-the-attic"},"nextItem":{"title":"Test 2","permalink":"/blog/testpost2"}},"content":"\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e"},{"id":"testpost2","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/testpost2","source":"@site/blog/Testpost2.md","title":"Test 2","description":"This is a test post #2","date":"2024-01-24T10:34:54.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Test","permalink":"/blog/tags/tags/test","description":"Test posts."}],"readingTime":0.03,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Dad Writes Tech","title":"Technical Writer, Dad, and newb Gamer","imageURL":"https://www.dad-writes-tech.com/images/avatar.jpg","key":"DadWritesTech","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"testpost2","title":"Test 2","date":"2024-01-24T10:34:54.000Z","description":"This is a test post #2","authors":["DadWritesTech"],"tags":["test"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Test 1","permalink":"/blog/testpost"}},"content":"\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n```JSON\\n{\\n    \\"This\\":\\"is code\\"\\n}\\n```"}]}}')}}]);
