## Windows 11's Context Menu: A Usability Downgrade? (And My Workaround)

I still remember the first time I right-clicked something in Windows XP. I had no idea what a “context menu” was back then—I just knew that right-clicking felt like unlocking a *hidden cheat code* for my PC. Fast forward through Vista, 7, 8 (ugh), and 10, and I’ve gotten pretty comfortable with how Windows handles everyday tasks.  

But then Windows 11 came along. And… yeah. This new right-click menu? Not a fan.

## Why the New Context Menu Feels Like a Downgrade

Microsoft decided, in its infinite wisdom, to *hide* most of the right-click options behind a “Show more options” button. Now, I sort of get the logic.  

- Performance – Maybe a slimmer menu loads faster? (I never had an issue before, but okay.)  
- Simplification – Casual users probably don’t need 90% of those options anyway.  

But for people like me—who right-click constantly throughout the day(mostly nervously refreshing.. :D)—this extra step feels like someone moved my coffee mug an inch to the left every time I reach for it. Small change, big annoyance.

And here’s the kicker: the full menu is still there. Microsoft just buried it under an extra step, like some kind of twisted usability prank.  

## The Shift+Right-Click Shortcut (A Band-Aid Fix)

There *is* a workaround—if you hold *Shift* and Right-Click, it brings up the old-school full menu instantly. I found this out after an embarrassing amount of frustration, clicking “Show more options” like some kind of NPC stuck in a loop.  

Does it work? Yeah.

Does it feel like an unnecessary extra step? Also yeah.  

It’s like adding a secret handshake to open your own fridge. *Why?*

## The Real Fix: Bringing Back the Classic Menu (Registry Edit)  

After realizing I was one click away from losing my mind, I did some digging. Turns out, you can restore the old menu permanently with a quick registry edit.  

Quick warning: Messing with the registry is like doing surgery on your OS—screw it up, and things can go sideways fast. Back up your registry before you try this.  

### Here’s how to fix it

1. Open Command Prompt
   - Hit *Win + R* (or use windows search, if you prefer it), type `cmd`, and press Enter.  

2. Paste this command and hit Enter:

   ```sh
   reg add HKCU\Software\Classes\CLSID\{86ca1aa0-34aa-4e8b-a509-50c905bae2a2}\InprocServer32 /ve /d "" /f
   ```  

3. Restart Explorer (or Just Reboot Your PC)  
   - Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open Task Manager.  
   - Find **Windows Explorer**, right-click it, and choose **Restart**.  

And just like that—Boom! The classic context menu is back.  

>If it did'nt work, it's likely you are not logged in with Admin permissions. If that is the case, contact your administrator to do this for you, or stick with using *Shift*+ Right-Click.

## Undoing the Change (If You Ever Want To)

If for some reason, you start *missing* the “Show more options” button (hey, you do you), here’s how to undo the tweak:  

```sh
reg delete HKCU\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{86ca1aa0-34aa-4e8b-a509-50c905bae2a2} /f
```  

Restart Explorer again (or your PC), and it’ll go back to the Windows 11 default.  

## Final Thoughts: Microsoft, Just Give Us the Option (a toggle at least)

Honestly, this never needed to be an issue in the first place. The new context menu isn’t *bad*—it just should’ve been optional. Let users choose between the new style and the classic menu. Problem solved.  

But knowing Microsoft? Yeah… I won’t hold my breath.
